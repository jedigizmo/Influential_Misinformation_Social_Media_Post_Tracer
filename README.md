# Influential_Misinformation_Social_Media_Post_Tracer
This project models the spread of misinformation by constructing a BERT-based semantic similarity network of news posts and simulating influence propagation using the Independent Cascade model. Using Hill Climbing optimization, it identifies the most influential fake news posts and visualizes their impact across the network.
